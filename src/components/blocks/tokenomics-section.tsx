              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">2017.</strong> I was 14 when I first dipped my toes into reselling shoes.
                Back then, it was pure chaos - no proxies, no sophisticated with captcha solving, just raw speed and luck.
                I was one of the first kids my age running scripts to cop Jordans, Nikes, and anything hyped.
                Those early days taught me I'd never be able to give up.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Then came the backdoor era.</strong> When traditional botting got too saturated
                and too difficult, I pivoted to backdooring, working directly with Footlocker, JD sports, and
                Nike staff. I learned how to connect with these people, to make money together.
                That's when I realized the real money wasn't made alone, but with others.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">The proxy era hit.</strong> Suddenly, everyone was using residential proxies,
                VPNs, and headless browsers. The game changed overnight. I had to level up fast.
                Started building my own proxy networks, rotating IPs, developing custom fingerprints
                and started to make money selling on grey-hat forums to other scalpers.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Fast forward to Pokemon.</strong> I've seen every iteration of this space
                from the wild west of Supreme bots to the corporate takeover of Shopify. Pokemon cards?
                That's just sneaker culture meets collectibles. Same game, different assets. I know exactly
                where the inefficiencies are, where the whales lurk, and how to build something that actually
                works for the average scalper.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong className="text-white">Why I hate most bots around now?</strong> Because they're cringe. Built by people
                who maximise for licenses sold and not quality of service.
                No understanding of the game nor any respect for the people they're servicing.
                Scalp on Sol is different - it's built by someone who's been in the trenches,
                who understands the ecosystem, and who actually cares about the community.
